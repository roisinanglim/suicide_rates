# Data Simulation of Suicide rates in Ireland 
======================================================

The repository focuses on simulating a dataset based on suicide rates in Ireland. 

The dataset was simulated using the numpy random package, using probabilities obtained from the World Health Organisations suicide rates and the central statistics office suicide data. 

The repository displays python code with instuctions on how to; 

*Convert dataframes from a 1D to a 2D array
* Combine dataframes 
* Randomly generate data using the numpy random package 
* Plot and interpret simulated data
