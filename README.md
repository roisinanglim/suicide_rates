# Data Simulation of Suicide rates in Ireland 

This repository focuses on simulating a dataset based on suicide rates in Ireland. 

The dataset was simulated using the NumPy random package, using probabilities obtained from the World Health Organisations suicide rates and the central statistics office suicide data. 

The repository displays python code with instructions on how to; 

*Convert data frames from a 1D to a 2D array
* Combine data frames 
* Randomly generate data using the NumPy random package 
* Plot and interpret simulated data
